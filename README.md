## Basic Deep Learning online Course 
[Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more.

## Deep Learning Books
[Grokking Deep Learning Book pdf](https://github.com/aniruddhachoudhury/Data-Science-Books/blob/master/Grokking%20Deep%20Learning%20-%20MEAP%20v10.pdf) is a
great resource for developing a strong mental model and intuition about the mechanism underlying deep neural networks.

[Deep Learning by Goodfellow](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) For a thorough introduction and reference

## Deep Learning Frameworks and online material
[Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/deep-learning-with-pytorch) It covers the basics and abstractions in great detail, tearing apart the underpinnings of data structures like tensors and neural networks and making sure you understand their implementation.

## Full Stack Deep Learning Course
[Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) helps you bridge the gap from training machine learning models to deploying AI systems in the real world
