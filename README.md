## Full Stack Deep Learning Course
[Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) helps you bridge the gap from training machine learning models to deploying AI systems in the real world

## Deep Learning Books
[Grokking Deep Learning Book pdf](https://github.com/aniruddhachoudhury/Data-Science-Books/blob/master/Grokking%20Deep%20Learning%20-%20MEAP%20v10.pdf) is a
great resource for developing a strong mental model and intuition about the mechanism underlying deep neural networks.

[Deep Learning by Goodfellow](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) For a thorough introduction and reference

## Deep Learning Frameworks and online material
[Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/deep-learning-with-pytorch) It covers the basics and abstractions in great detail, tearing apart the underpinnings of data structures like tensors and neural networks and making sure you understand their implementation.
